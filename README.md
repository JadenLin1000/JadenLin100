## Proll's Game Site
My gamesite has started to get blocked so I decided to make the source public. 

You can deploy this via any host like:
<ul>
<li>netlify</li>
<li>cloudpages</li>
<li>github pages</li>
</ul>

Please dont remove my name from my work. Ive been working on this website for 2 years and will contiune to update every weekday during the school year untill further notice.

To request new games please use this button. I check this form every week. This will also have a updated unblocked link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VaOL09uAinpz_JvXJCgJjkfMOoLCNJzxIpJn0737FVc/viewform?edit_requested=true&pli=1" class="button">Request Game Form</a>
